Garbage line that doesn't belong here!!!
Initial Observations:
- The file contains a mix of structured and unstructured logs.
- Entries can be categorized into:
- System Logs (INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
- User Score Data
- Sensor Readings (Temperature)
- Junk/Malformed lines
- The data is timestamped, allowing chronological analysis.
- Some entries are clean and follow a pattern, while others are noisy.
Assumption:
- We can filter and structure the logs based on keywords and patterns using shell tools.
